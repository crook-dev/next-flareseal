## Flare Connection Leaks in the HVAC Industry

Flare connection leaks are a common problem in the HVAC industry. They can be caused by a number of factors, including:

- Improper installation
- Damage to the flare nut or fitting
- Corrosion

To prevent flare connection leaks, it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions when installing the connections. It is also important to use the correct tools and materials.

## Use the Correct Tools and Materials

When installing a flare connection, it is important to use the correct tools and materials. The wrong tools can damage the flare nut or fitting, and the wrong materials can corrode.

Here are some tips for choosing the correct tools and materials:

- Use a flare nut wrench that is the correct size for the flare nut.
- Use a flare fitting wrench that is the correct size for the flare fitting.
- Use a flaring tool that is the correct size for the pipe or tube.
- Use a torque wrench to tighten the flare nut to the manufacturer's specifications.
- Use corrosion-resistant materials, such as stainless steel or brass.

## Follow the Manufacturer's Instructions

The manufacturer's instructions will provide you with the specific steps you need to take to install the flare connection correctly. It is important to follow these instructions carefully.

Here are some tips for following the manufacturer's instructions:

- Read the instructions carefully before you start installing the flare connection.
- Gather all of the necessary tools and materials before you start.
- Follow the instructions step-by-step.
- Do not skip any steps.
- If you are not sure how to do something, ask for help.

## Use a Torque Wrench

A torque wrench is a tool that is used to tighten bolts to a specific torque value. When installing a flare connection, it is important to use a torque wrench to tighten the flare nut to the manufacturer's specifications.

Here are some tips for using a torque wrench:

- Set the torque wrench to the manufacturer's specifications.
- Tighten the flare nut slowly and evenly.
- Do not overtighten the flare nut.

## Inspect the Connections Regularly

It is important to inspect the flare connections on your HVAC system regularly. Look for signs of damage, such as cracks or leaks. If you see any damage, the flare connection should be replaced.

Here are some tips for inspecting flare connections:

- Visually inspect the connections for signs of damage.
- Use a leak detector to check for leaks.
- If you find any damage, replace the flare connection immediately.

## Use Corrosion-Resistant Materials

Flare connections that are made from corrosion-resistant materials are less likely to leak. Stainless steel and brass are two types of materials that are resistant to corrosion.

## Minimize Vibration

Vibration can cause flare connections to leak. If your HVAC system is located in an area that is prone to vibration, you can take steps to minimize the vibration, such as by using vibration isolation pads.

## Use FlareSeal速

FlareSeal速 is a copper multi-ring seal that provides a superior seal on flare connections. The seal is designed to protect against the primary area of flare leaks, on the sealing surface. FlareSeal速 fits all common SAE flare connections and can be used to stop weeping connections in existing systems.

By following these tips, you can help to prevent flare connection leaks in your HVAC system.
