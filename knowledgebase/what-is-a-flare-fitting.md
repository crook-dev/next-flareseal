A flare fitting is a type of compression fitting used when working with metal tubing. They are commonly made from soft steel and copper, but can originate from other materials as well. Tube flaring is considered to be a type of forging operation, and is usually a cold working procedure. Using a special tool to assemble, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal.

Flared connections are very reliable, and when you add a flare seal they are virtually leak-free. The flare fitting connection is also easy to disassemble, giving all the benefits of a permanent fixture without the constraints. For this reason flare fittings are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations such as HVAC systems, fuel and gas lines and refrigeration units.
